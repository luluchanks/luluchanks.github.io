                Lesgo is a concept application that allows users to discover nearby events in their city,
                read reviews, check out photos, and purchase tickets in advance to avoid wait times.
                Imagine traveling to a new city and being able to sort through all the different fitness,
                music, food, and creative events at your fingertips!

                <p>
                  According to survey results, the majority of users discover events
                  via word of mouth, <strong>32.3%</strong>,
                  and <strong>29%</strong> via Facebook. These statistics show that
                  finding events rely heavily on people's network of
                  friends, therefore making it difficult to
                  for some to discover new ones. As discovered through user
                  interviews, some people go through a long
                  process of finding photos of
                  events on Instagram, then reading
                  previous attendee’s reviews on Yelp, and finally
                  purchasing tickets on the event website.

                Lesgo makes the process of discovering
                nearby event streamlined for users -
                users can discover events, read reviews,

                <em>This case study involved user
                research, user personas, user testing,
                competitive analyses, wireframing, and
                prototyping (InVision) completed in a
                span of 4 weeks.

              I used this information to help make design decisions and proceed forward in developing Lesgo.
              There seemed to be a trend that most people found events through word of mouth or social media.

              <p>
                Prior to making any design decisions, I created a survey
                to send out to potentials users of Lesgo.  From previous
                experience, it is easy to get into the mindset of designing
                for oneself.  <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/hpG5HE9b2JokeMwF2" target="_blank">A user survey</a>
                was the perfect opportunity to better understand the perspectives
                of my users as well as gain insight on how they find events.
                Some questions that were asked:
              </p>

              <div class="light_bg">
                <ul>
                  <li>How do you discover nearby events?</li>

              </div>

              <p>
                This survey was distributed via online forums and social media.
                About 25 responses were obtained, and the key insights were as following:

                  <li>55% of users always share events with friends, 45% do sometimes</li>

              To create an application that would be useful for my users and to better
              understand my competitors, I performed an analysis.  I chose to research Yelp,
              Time Out, and Fever; I wanted to see how Yelp emphasized the idea of leaving
              reviews for events and venues while discovering areas for improvement.
              Time Out and Fever are apps that allow users to find events; however,
              I wanted to identify their areas for improvement.

            I chose the name Lesgo as play on words for “Let’s Go.”
            In regards to the mobile icon, I chose a location pin with
            an arrow going through it to represent going to a new event.

            After making quick low fidelity hand sketches, I moved forward
            with mid fidelity wireframes.  My primary design goal was to make
            a simple user interface that allowed users to quickly find nearby events,
            information, images, reviews, and proceed with an in-app purchase of tickets.
            The product had to make this process streamline and succinct enough to
            not discourage users from purchasing tickets.  Lesgo would ideally
            remove the stress of having to switch through different websites
            and mobile applications to find and purchase tickets for events.
            The purpose of creating mid fidelity wireframes would be to determine
            the hierarchy of information, a grid system, and specific images needed.

            Using the mid fidelity wireframes that were made, I created a clickable prototype using InVision.
            As this made the user flows more tangible, I performed in-person user tests,
            specifically navigation tests.  This allowed me to gain a new perspective,
            personal feedback in terms of information architecture, and identify confusing design elements.
            The information gained from testing was extremely valuable. I used their feedback to
            make design decisions when creating high fidelity wireframes for Lesgo.

            I discovered that the descriptive text on the onboarding process
            did not give much information about Lesgo. Therefore, improvements were made to better describe
            all the uses of Lesgo. In addition, rather than forcing users to scroll
            through each onboarding page and image, having fixed ‘Log In’ and ‘Sign Up’
            buttons would be much easier for returning users.

            Through my users, I've learned the importance of specificity with descriptions and call-to-action buttons.
            For this particular example, many users did not understand what was being shared.
            One user explained that they thought Lesgo had to be shared with friends in order to
            enter the app itself, rather than sharing their location. Simply stating ‘Share Location’
            in replacement of ‘Share’ resolved this confusion.

            Users stated that the pins on the map did not show enough detail to convey information.
            Also, it was difficult for them to identify their location in relation to the map.
            I also realized that I needed to differentiate the selected event from the other pins.
            Lastly, the typography displaying the event information was too small and illegible.

            Users stated that the toggle buttons for selecting a payment method was odd and made them feel
            more inclined to make an accidental error.  To resolve this issue, I created
            a second screen to select the desired payment option. After selecting a payment method,
            the user will return to the checkout flow and can verify they selected the correct option.

            User testing has taught me that following traditional UX conventions ensures trust
            with users.  In this example, in the mid fidelity wireframe, I did not mention any
            email confirmations when making a purchase on Lesgo. Users explained they would
            prefer email confirmations in addition to in-app tickets, as that is the convention
            they are accustomed to.

            <h3>User Accounts</h3>
            <p>
              As previously mentioned, most people discover events through word of mouth
              and social media.  This information stressed the importance of connecting
              social media to Lesgo. In addition, survey results showed that 100% users
              often share events with friends; therefore a prominent sharing feature
              would be very important.
              <br />
              <br />
              Another necessary user flow would be to update payment settings --
              adding credit or debit cards, Paypal, and Apple Pay.  Users should also be
              able to view previous purchases for events.
            </p>

          <h3 class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">Purchasing Tickets</h3>
          <p class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
            Lesgo allows users to purchase tickets in advance to avoid wait
            times and to secure spots. Survey results show that 95.2% of users
            purchase tickets through an event website or mobile app.  When designing
            the wireframes for purchasing tickets, I carefully thought through
            the process to ensure simplicity and security.  Through user testing,
            I learned that many users prefer both in-app tickets as well as email
            confirmation, as that is the most common convention.
          </p>
          <h3 class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">Rating &amp; Reviewing</h3>
          <p class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2">
            Another important feature of Lesgo is the ability to leave
            reviews and post photos.  100% of users find importance in
            images or videos shared by previous event attendees.  85% of
            users occasionally look at reviews left for events.  These
            statistics represent the significance of a user being able
            to read, write, and share reviews.  When designing user flows
            for leaving reviews, I thought it would be useful if there
            were multiple ways to do so.

          <p class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
            Lesgo was my first experience creating a mobile application for iOS.
            I tried my best to adhere to iOS Human Interface Guidelines while designing
            Lesgo in regards to consistency in text styles, interface elements, and icons.
            If time wasn’t a constraint, I would have ideally liked to create an Android
            version reflecting the Android Material Design guidelines. In terms of
            the design process, I would have liked to spend more time focusing on wireframes.
            I focused on creating wireframes for a minimal viable product; a few features
            I would’ve liked to create are a filter function that allows users to sort
            through events and wireframes to set notifications for new upcoming events.
            <br />
            <br />
            Designing Lesgo taught me the importance of user testing.
            It is easy to get into the mindset of designing for oneself,
            but testing and interviewing allowed me to experience and think like a user.
            For future design projects, I’d like to test prototypes as soon as possible
            in order to gather more feedback and incorporate more iterations.
