            <p class="col-sm-6">I’ve always had a love for art and later on design, but my path towards design was not a straightforward one.  Growing up with a family of health professionals made me think that design was a hobby, not a career.  So to follow in the footsteps of my successful relatives, I worked towards becoming a physician.  My high school schedule consisted of science courses, except for two courses in art and graphic design.  I applied to universities with great biology programs; however, my art teacher pulled me aside and asked if medicine was something I truly wanted to do.  I began to question my aspiration and applied to one architecture school thinking it was a good balance between design and science.  Those three semesters in architecture school were great, but I knew it wasn’t for me.  I ended up transferring schools and switched back to the pre-medical route.  I took intensive science courses and graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in biological sciences.  While studying for the Medical College Admissions Test, I realized I was pursuing my family’s dreams, not my own.  I felt hopeless and a failure.  I did some soul searching and questioned what things truly make me happy.  Soon enough, I realized that design and creativity were recurring themes in everything I did, as noted in those 6 items above.  A couple months after graduating, I discovered Bloc Inc’s design apprenticeship and knew immediately user experience and user interface design was the track for me.  Words can’t describe the feeling of finally doing something I truly love -- exercising my creativity by solving problems through design.

            Other than designing, you could catch me eating, cooking, working out, drawing, and binge watching anime! I’m always learning &amp; always creating~</p>
