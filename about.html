  TL;DR: Design was always .... , it just took a couple of turns before realizing. With a background in biological sciences, I've learned the value of process in not only experiments or research, but also in life. The constant process of failing, acknowledging the problem, and reiterating until a solution is pinpointed. The process of going through ups and downs to get to a place you truly value.  If it wasn't for the meandering path I've taken to where I am now, I wouldn't be as appreciative to finally be called a designer.

I was probably born with a crayon in my hand, but Like many kids raised in the early 2000s, I grew up designing web layouts and banners for my xanga blog and MySpace website.  For one Christmas, I asked for the "Adobe Photoshop for Dummies" book and learned all the basics; I even learned to make awful gifs on it! I would create custom banners and backgrounds for my blog, usually inspired by my favorite anime. I loved the creative freedom and being able to make things from scratch. At the time, I had no idea careers in web or graphic design even existed. Instead, growing up in a Filipino American household taught me that a career in medicine, particularly becoming a physician, meant a life of high status and monetary stability.

It wasn't until my senior year of high school when I first began to question my career path. After taking all the science courses my high school offered, I had space in my schedule to take two electives - graphic design and studio art. I slowly began to immerse myself in art and design; they became the highlight of my day. Coincidentally(?), in the midst of college applications, my two teachers pulled me aside to discuss my college plans. They both saw something in me that I had never seen in myself, that I had an eye for art and design. They both asked, "are you sure you're pursuing medicine for you and not your family?"
Conflicted with the ideals of my family and my own aspirations, I began to venture into different career paths.

I listened to my gut and changed my intended major at New Jersey Institute of Technology from biological sciences to architecture, thinking it was a good balance between design and science. I completed three awesome semesters of architecture school before realizing that although I love design, architecture wasn't the right field for me. I learned the key principles of form over function (?), new skills in graphic design and 3D rendering, and to design spaces and products that were defined for people and specific purposes.

Feeling defeated and unsure of my future, I succumbed to my family's wishes and I transferred to Rutgers University to pursue a degree in biological sciences. There, I took all the required premedical courses, researched at the cancer institute of New Jersey, and became a member of the only premedical fraternity on campus. During college, I worked part time as a computer lab supervisor for the Office of Information Technology. This job taught me so much as well as allowed me to keep a hold of my creativity. I was given the role as the design supervisor; I created all the flyers and digital marketing for about 25 different computer labs on campus(?). Also, I had the opportunity to teach Intro to Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator classes to the computer lab consultants.

While graduation was right around the corner, I began studying for the medical college admissions test, and quickly realized I was pursuing medicine for all the wrong reasons. I started to reflect and think about what is it I truly wanted to do. I realized in all my jobs, I found a way to incorporate my creativity into it, whether it be through promotional flyers, videos, website designs, and problem solving. I had an amazing time as an undergraduate at Rutgers, but I couldn't help but think I finished with the wrong major.

(Talk more about process after graduation)
Graduation was surreal, but I couldn't fully savor the moment without the unsettling fear of my future take over.
After graduating, I slowly taught myself basic programming through free online tutorials, books, and introductory to programming bootcamp courses. I discovered Bloc, Inc., and their intensive design apprenticeship, in which you learn all the foundations of user experience and front end development. I did thorough research into the program as well as the field of UX/UI, and realized this was everything I loved - human-centered design, research, problem solving, and programming. I requested info
