    I’ve always had a love for art and later on design, but my path towards design
    was not a straightforward one. I was probably born with a crayon in my hand,
    but like many kids raised in the early 2000s, I grew up designing anime-inspired
    web layouts and banners for my xanga blog and MySpace website. At the time,
    I had no idea careers in web or graphic design even existed. Instead, growing
    up in a Filipino American household taught me that a career in medicine,
    particularly becoming a physician, meant a life of status and monetary stability.
  <br />
  <br />

    Rather than following my gut, I ended up graduating from Rutgers University
    with the feeling that I finished with the wrong major. I received my Bachelors
    of Arts in biological sciences, took all the required premedical courses,
    researched at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey, and became a member of the
    only premedical fraternity on campus. Although science truly taught me critical
    thinking, resilience (organic chemistry!), and the importance of iteration
    (medical research), I couldn't help but feel like something was missing.
    I knew I enjoyed helping people but never thought I could do so through
    design or using my creativity. It wasn't until I stumbled upon user
    experience design and realized I could solve people's everyday problems
    through well thought out design solutions.
  <br />
  <br />
    With a background in biological sciences, I've learned the value of process in not only experiments or
    research, but also in life. The constant process of failing, acknowledging
    the problem, and reiterating until a solution is pinpointed. The process
    of going through ups and downs to get to a place you truly value.  <strong>If it
    wasn't for the meandering path I've taken to where I am now, I wouldn't
    be as appreciative to finally be called a designer.</strong>
  <br />
  <br />
  Other than designing, you could catch me eating, cooking, working out, drawing,
  and hanging out with my dog, Penny! I’m always learning &amp; always creating~
